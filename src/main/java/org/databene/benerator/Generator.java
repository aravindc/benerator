/**
 * This is the basic Generator interface, the mother of all generators.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Generator States</b><br/>
 * A Generator may be in one of three states:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><i>constructing</i>: The generator is under construction.
 *       This may take several steps, since generators need to be JavaBeans.
 *       The generator may transit into the available state automatically
 *       or manually when the validate() method is called.</li>
 *   <li><i>available</i>: Generator construction is done and the generator is available.
 *       The user may loop the Generator via generate().</li>
 *   <li><i>unavailable</i>: The Generator may become unavailable automatically if its value space is depleted or
 *        manually when close() has been invoked. The Generator may be made <i>available</i> again by calling reset().
 *        When <i>unavailable</i>, the generator must be in a state in which it can be safely garbage collected.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Developer Notes:</b><br/>
 * When implementing a custom generator, you should make it a JavaBean:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implement a public default (no-arg) constructor</li>
 *   <li>make each relevant property configurable by a set-method</li>
 * </ul>
