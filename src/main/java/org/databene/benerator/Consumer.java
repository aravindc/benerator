/**
 * Abstraction of an object that consumes (possibly larger quantities of) objects.
 * Consumation is a two-step process: For each object A to be consumed, Benerator 
 * first calls {@link #startConsuming(ProductWrapper)}, then 
 * {@link #finishConsuming(ProductWrapper)} with a wrapper of this object: 
 * <pre>
 * 	startConsuming(A);
 * 	finishConsuming(A);
 * </pre>
 * If an object A has a 'sub object' B, (defined via nested a &gt;generate&lt; 
 * statement), Benerator represents the recursion by the following invocation sequence:
 * <pre>
 * 	startConsuming(A);
 * 	startConsuming(B);
 * 	finishConsuming(B);
 * 	finishConsuming(A);
 * </pre>
