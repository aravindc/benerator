 * Interface for the GoF 'Command' pattern.
 * General usage is to call the executeStep() method once or several times for executing the task's work.
 * After usage, close() must be called. 
 * When implementing the Task interface, you should preferably inherit from 
 * {@link AbstractTask}, this may compensate for future interface changes.<br/>
