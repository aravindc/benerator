  <comment>benerator is a framework for creating realistic and valid high-volume test data, used for
        testing (unit/integration/load) and showcase setup.
        Metadata constraints are imported from systems and/or configuration files. Data can imported from
        and exported to files and systems, anonymized or generated from scratch. Domain packages provide
        reusable generators for creating domain-specific data as names and addresses internationalizable
        in language and region. It is strongly customizable with plugins and configuration options.</comment>
